Description:
------------

idea.mod is a replacement for the blowfish module that comes with Eggdrop.
It uses MD5 hashing for password checking, and the IDEA block cipher in
CFB mode for encrypting strings.

As this module is new, there still may be some bugs. If you find one, please
report it to paladin@techmonkeys.org.

idea.mod-2.2 is for Eggdrop version 1.8.4 and greater. If you have an
older Eggdrop, use the original 1.0.2 instead.

NOTE:  You will need to start a new user file if you have been using
       blowfish as your encryption module, as the two are not compatible.

Installation:
-------------

This modification of idea.mod has only been tested with 1.8.4, and may or may not
work with other versions.

You need the eggdrop source to compile the module.

The following instructions assume, ~/eggdrop-1.8.x/ is the directory
where the eggdrop source code is.

Put idea.mod-2.2.tar.gz in ~/eggdrop-1.8.x/src/mod/,
and unpack it (tar zxf idea.mod-2.2.tar.gz).

Now change back to ~/eggdrop-1.8.x/ and compile your bot normally:

./configure
make
make config (or iconfig)
make install

Usage:
------

idea.mod provides the same TCL commands as blowfish.mod:

encpass <password>
encrypt <key> <string>
decrypt <key> <string>


Known Problems:
---------------

None.
